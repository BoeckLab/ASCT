ASCT Figure Scripts
This folder contains the analysis scripts (R and Rmd) used to generate the ASCT figure outputs.
They are provided to support transparency and reproducibility of the analyses.
Each script includes a brief description of its main purpose and a short summary of the steps it performs.
Some figures are not represented here because they can be generated directly from the source data using simple visualisation or statistical tools (e.g., Prism).
