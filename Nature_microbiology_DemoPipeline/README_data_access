# ASCT Image Analysis Pipeline (Demonstration)

Because the raw experimental data are extremely large (approximately **7 TB per experiment**, with multiple experiments conducted), it is not feasible to share the complete dataset via GitHub. Due to GitHubâ€™s size limitations, the full data cannot be uploaded here.  

To address this, we provide a **demonstration pipeline** that illustrates, step by step, how a **single field image** and a **single condition** are processed and analyzed.

## Access to Algorithms, Data, and Code

The ASCT image analysis algorithms, image data, and code are substantial in size and cannot be hosted directly on GitHub.  

All necessary resources are freely accessible via Switchdrive at the following link:

As an alternative, the same demonstration pipeline can also be accessed via Zenodo using the following private preview link:

To ensure long-term accessibility, we are also preparing a deposition of these files in a permanent repository (Zenodo), where they will be assigned a DOI once the dataset is formally published. The DOI will be provided here once available.

## Installation and Execution Instructions

Detailed instructions on **installation** and **how to execute the pipeline** are provided in the accompanying PDF:
