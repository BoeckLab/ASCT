# ASCT Image Analysis Pipeline (Demonstration)

Because the raw experimental data are extremely large (approximately **7 TB per experiment**, with multiple experiments conducted), it is not feasible to share the complete dataset via GitHub. Due to GitHubâ€™s size limitations, the full data cannot be uploaded here.  

To address this, we provide a **demonstration pipeline** that illustrates, step by step, how a **single field image** and a **single condition** are processed and analyzed.

## Access to Algorithms, Data, and Code

The ASCT image analysis algorithms, image data, and code are substantial in size and cannot be hosted directly on GitHub.  
All necessary resources are freely accessible via Switchdrive at the following link:

## Installation and Execution Instructions

Detailed instructions on **installation** and **how to execute the pipeline** are provided in the accompanying PDF:

Please download the PDF from this repository and follow the step-by-step guidance for setting up required software (Fiji, ilastik, MATLAB, and R), running the demonstration pipeline, and performing downstream data analysis.
